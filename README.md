# Practical Work II – Personal Website

## Description of the work

This project consists of the development of a personal website using HTML and CSS.
The goal is to demonstrate the knowledge acquired in the subject by creating several
interconnected web pages that present information about myself and my degree.

The website includes a main page, an "About me" section, a topic page, a network page,
a contact form, a degree overview, and a dedicated page for the subject
"Fundamentals of Computer Engineering".

## Website structure

- `index.html`: Main page with general information about the website.
- `public/about.html`: About me, curriculum vitae, images and social media links.
- `public/topic.html`: Topic page about a chosen subject (Introduction to HTML and CSS).
- `public/net.html`: Network page with links to partner websites.
- `public/contact.html`: Static contact form (no data is sent or stored).
- `public/degree.html`: Description of the double degree and a table of subjects.
- `public/fce.html`: Detailed page about Fundamentals of Computer Engineering.
- `css/style.css`: Global stylesheet shared by all pages.
- `images/`: Folder that contains the images used in the website.

## Problems during the development

- Initial organisation of folders and files to follow the required project structure.
- Correct use of relative paths between the root folder and the `public` folder.
- Designing a simple but consistent CSS file that works for all pages.
- Configuration of Git, GitHub repository and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Conclusions

The project has helped to consolidate basic skills in HTML and CSS, as well as
to understand the structure of a small multi-page website. In addition, it has
provided practical experience with version control using Git and with publishing
a website using GitHub Pages.
